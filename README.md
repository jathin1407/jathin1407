# Hey there 👋 I'm Jathin!

I'm a curious-minded data analyst who loves uncovering patterns — whether it's in a billion rows of retail data, on a football field, or in my Spotify history. I started my career in support roles, solving incidents. But I kept asking “why?” — and that curiosity pulled me into the world of analytics.

Now I build dashboards, write SQL, automate workflows, and deliver insights that drive decisions. I enjoy working across data pipelines, from wrangling raw data to presenting clear stories using Power BI and Tableau.

Let’s connect — whether it’s about data, football, or just your latest playlist drop!
